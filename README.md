# RTL-DC-Motor

• Faculty: Aftab Hussain

• TA: Navnit

In this project, a system will be created to measure the speed of a DC motor for an applied input voltage. The students are expected to plot speed vs voltage for no load operation and compare with theoretical expectations. Further, the power consumed by the motor can be calculated using the current and voltage inputs.


**NOTE:** Do not push directly to the main branch. First commit and push dummy branch for each part that has been created then compare & pull to `main` branch.

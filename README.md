# RTL-DC-Motor
In this project, a system will be created to measure the speed of a DC motor for an applied input voltage. The students are expected to plot speed vs voltage for no load operation and compare with theoretical expectations. Further, the power consumed by the motor can be calculated using the current and voltage inputs.
